Humanity is progressing faster than ever before. We have smartwatches, VR goggles, electric vehicles and all the cool gadgets thanks to all the developments in science & research over the last decade. But how exactly did these things became possible?

# A planet rich in resources

Unlike most planets of our solar system, filled with gases, we live in one of the rockiest planets ﹣ The Earth. And within our planet, we have an abundance of elements such as silicon, copper, lithium, gold, etc. which enables us to build complex buildings, machinery and circuits.

These elements are vital to the progress of the modern mankind. They are formed by different combination of protons and neutrons held together by strong nuclear force and electrons that move around them attracted by the positive charge of the protons.

This difference in structures of various elements gives them unique properties making them suitable for building different components of our technology. Infact, they all follow a common pattern in their structure and we decided to organize them based on their atomic structure in tables called ﹣ "The Periodic Table"
