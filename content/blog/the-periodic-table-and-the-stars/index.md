Humanity is progressing faster than ever before. We have smartwatches, VR goggles, electric vehicles and all the cool gadgets thanks to all the developments in science & research over the last decade. But how exactly did these things became possible?

# A planet rich in resources

Unlike most planets of our solar system, which are filled with gases, we live in one of the rockiest planets ﹣ The Earth. And within our planet, we have an abundance of elements such as silicon, copper, lithium, gold, etc. which enables us to build complex buildings, machinery and circuits.

These elements are vital to the progress of the modern mankind. They are formed by different combination of protons and neutrons held together by **strong nuclear force** and electrons that move around them attracted by the positive charge of the protons.

This difference in structures of various elements gives them unique properties, making them suitable for building different components of our technology. They all follow a common pattern in their structure we decided to organize them based on their atomic structure in a table called ﹣ "The Periodic Table"

## Periodic Table

<div class="post-image-container"><img class="post-image" alt="periodic-table" src="2880px-Simple_Periodic_Table_Chart-en.svg.png"/></div><p><small>Image from <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table">Wikipedia</a></small></p>

A quick search in google returns an interesting definition for the periodic table ﹣

> A table of the chemical elements arranged in order of atomic number, usually in rows, so that elements with similar atomic structure (and hence similar chemical properties) appear in vertical columns.

Elements are built by the combination of atoms and these atoms are made of protons, neutrons and electrons. In 1869, Russian chemist [Dimitri Mendeleev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Mendeleev) decided to organize the different elements into a system by arranging these elements in the order of increasing [atomic weight](https://www.britannica.com/science/atomic-weight) and also grouped them in such a way that the elements with similar properties are placed together. He realized a pattern began to form in his arrangement system. Back then, when only about 60 elements were known to man, he had left blank placeholders in his system for the future generations to fill in.

This system of organization was later known to be the Periodic Table. The places that were left blank were eventually filled up with new elements that were discovered later. This system works so well that we can predict the existence & properties of elements before we can even discover them.

Modern periodic table has elements organized by their atomic number ﹣ sum of protons and neutrons in their nuclei instead of the atomic weight and has about 118 elements. The rows in the table are called **periods** and there are 7 periods. The vertical columns are called **groups** or **families**. The periods 6 (lanthanoid series) & 7 (actinoid series) are too long that they have been moved into two separate rows at the bottom of the table so that they can be printed on paper easily.

The most interesting thing about the periodic table is that the elements belonging to the same group have similar characteristic properties. The protons in the atomic nuclei attract the electrons around it and when we move across the periodic table, the number of protons & neutrons in the atomic nuclei increases which in-turn attracts more electrons. Now these electrons are not always well balanced. Think of electrons as moving in multiple orbits around the nuclei. Then the electrons in the outermost orbit are called [valence electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_electron). These electrons determine the chemical reactivity of the element (the chemical bond the element can establish with other elements)

## Valence Electrons & Chemical Bonding

An element may have an arrangement of electrons where it's valence electrons are not stable and can either readily lose them or accept more electrons. When an element that can readily accept electrons come in contact with element that can easily lose electrons, they form a chemical bonding. 

***Ever wondered why iron easily rusts?*** Iron has an electron arrangement that it can readily accept 3 electrons while oxygen has an electron arrangement that it can lose 2 electrons. So by basic mathematics, 2 iron atoms can bond with 3 oxygen atoms and form iron oxide

## Group Properties

Just like how iron has an oxidation state, all the metals that belong to it's group has multiple oxidation states and they are commonly referred to as Transition Metals (Group 3 - 12). Some groups however, are very stable. For example, the Group 18 of the periodic table are all **noble gases**. The number of electrons in their atoms are well balanced that they don't need to gain or lose any extra electrons. Which makes them chemically stable and generally non-reactive to other elements

These noble gases have various applications. For example, Argon (`Ar`) an inert gas is used to fill electric light bulbs as they are highly non reactive and doesn't react with the Tungsten filament used in these bulbs.

## Semiconductors

Another interesting group of elements we can find in the periodic table are the semiconductors, a special set of elements that can either conduct electricity or not conduct electricity depending on the availability of free electrons. There are [different types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_materials) of semiconductors. But let's look at elemental semiconductors present in Group 14 (also knows as the carbon group). **Silicon** (`Si`) ﹣ a Group 14 elemental semiconductor is so widely used in modern computing, the famous ***Silicon Valley*** is named after it. 

<div class="post-image-container"><img class="post-image" alt="silicon-valley" src="silicon-valley.jpg"/></div><p><small>Image from <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Silicon_Valley,_facing_southward_towards_Downtown_San_Jose,_2014.jpg">Wikipedia</a></small></p>

Elements conduct electricity by letting electrons flow through them when electric current is passed. For this to happen they should be able to readily lose their valence electrons. A **good conductor** has only 1 valence electron which it can readily lose and hence let electricity flow through. A **bad conductor** (or insulator) however has a stable 8 valence electrons in which case, it will not allow electricity to flow. The semiconductors however have 4 valence electrons in which we can control if it should or should not conduct electricity.

Silicon as it's own doesn't conduct electricity. But if we add some Phosphorous to the silicon atoms, it will form a bond but leaves an extra free electron. This creates the excess negative charge and makes the material conduct electricity. This type of conducting electricity using additional negative charge is called [N-type](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-type_semiconductor) semiconductor.

Likewise, if you add Boron atoms to the mix, then it creates excess positive charge and then creates a [P-type](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-type_semiconductor) semiconductor. By arranging N-type and P-type semiconductors in specific ways we can allow either current to flow through them or completely block the current. This corresponds to 0's & 1's we use in modern computers and yes they form the basis of all the modern devices ﹣ [Transistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor). All the modern processors be it mobile, desktop or any smart IoT device, they have transistors as their base. For example, the latest Apple's A13 bionic chip has about 8.5 billion transistors built into it.

## Need more?

There are still a wide variety of elements available in the periodic table that we can use to build various pieces of modern technology. Elements like Gold, Silver, Platinum, Copper to name a few. And these elements form the **foundation of modern human society**.

As we move forward in the periodic table, the atomic number keeps on increasing. Which means the number of protons in the atomic nuclei is increasing. As it does, the repulsive force of the protons grow stronger against the strong nuclear force that is holding the atoms together. 

## Radioactivity

At atomic weight 145 we find an element called **Promethium** (`Pm`). The protons in the nuclei of this element is too heavy that it's strong nuclear force could not hold them together. This element undergoes a phenomena known as **Radioactive decay** where it decays to elements of smaller atomic number by emitting energy in the form of radiation.

<div class="post-image-container" style="width: 25%!important;"><img class="post-image" alt="radioactive-warning" src="512px-Radioactive.svg.png"/></div><p><small>Image from <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Radioactive.svg">Wikipedia</a></small></p>

As we move forward, we find more and more elements that are very unstable due to large number of protons in their atomic nuclei and undergo radioactive decay with the emission of harmful radiations like **Uranium** (`U`), **Plutonium** (`Pu`) etc. However, as dangerous as they sound, they form the primary power source of nuclear fission reactors which capitalize on the energy released when these elements split into elements of smaller atomic number.
